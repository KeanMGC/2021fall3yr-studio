"TINY HOUSE DESIGN: PART TO WHOLE - GLOBAL TO LOCAL â€” WENZHOU-KEAN UNIVERSITY" at the Global Tiny House Conference

The studio participated in th Global Tiny House Conference held September 30th - October 2nd 2021. You can watch the recording here:

The students worked hard to prepare their work for this conference. We encouraged all students to participate in the presentation. Unfortunately, we only had a few students willing to join us on a saturday morning. But I believe it was well worth it for those who did. Regardless we all had a good time being a part of a global dialog regarding housing constraints.
