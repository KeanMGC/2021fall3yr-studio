It is our pleasure to announce that [Grace, Yixuan Lin](https://gracell00l.github.io/prtflo/)'s entry in the [Empowered Living Design Competition](https://www.slc.gov/can/empowered-living); entitled "Guerilla Urbanism", was selected as a runner up in the Accessory Dwelling Unit catagory of the competition. She describes her project this way:

"On account of the high rents in Utah, Annex Garages are generated above garages in a community, those Annex Garage will be rent to young couples who working or seeking jobs in the Urbanism. The area of the Annex Garage is 32 square meters（it is depended on the size of original garage, but the proportions are uniform, and the one of original garage is 24 square meters, 7 square meters of the excess 8 square meters are used as stairs. 

Moreover, a double-sized garage can build two houses. Therefore, housekeepers can get additional rent income, and couples who work in the city do not have to pay expensive
rent. The main materials of the building are CLT wood, Standing Seam, mineral wool and solar panels. What’s more, the roof heating device can melt the snow on the roof
during the snowy winter in Salt Lake City to prevent the pressure on the roof caused by the accumulation of snow. In addition, there is a skylight (1.2m*1.2m) in the middle of the roof, which provides light to the room and a good view of the scenery. Furthermore, this room will not be disturbed by garage noise, thanks to noise-proof glass and 4 layers of CLT wood board (100mm)."
