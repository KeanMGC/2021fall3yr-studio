# Reflection on Previous Design

After discussing with teachers last week, I finally found the limitations of my design. If I want my work to stand out, I must have a highlight (I need to be the best in some way). Thus, I redesigned my house from the original luxury to more practical and meet the needs of residents.

My first highlight is that the overall space of the house is small, which can be loaded in containers and transported by trucks. The second is that the furniture can be moved or even multi-functional (such as four in one), so as to maximize the use of indoor space.
