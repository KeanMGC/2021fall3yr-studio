"TINY HOUSE DESIGN: PART TO WHOLE - GLOBAL TO LOCAL â€” WENZHOU-KEAN UNIVERSITY" at the Global Tiny House Conference

The studio participated in th Global Tiny House Conference held September 30th - October 2nd 2021. You can watch the recording here:

The students worked hard to prepare their work for this conference. We encouraged all students to participate in the presentation. Unfortunately, we only had a few students willing to join us on a saturday morning. But I believe it was well worth it for those who did. Regardless we all had a good time being a part of a global dialog regarding housing constraints.

Abstract:

David Vardy (Director of the WKU Design Institute) and R. Spencer Steenblik (Asist. Dir. Public Architecture and Design Research Institute) have been leading an architecture studio focused on the complexities of aggregated collections of informal, or grass roots housing development. The studio has begun the process by looking at a "tiny house" competition sponsored by AIA Utah and commissioned by the Salt Lake City Mayor Mendenhall. The Students in the studio from all over China offer ideas and opportunities applicable from Salt Lake City, to Shanghai.
