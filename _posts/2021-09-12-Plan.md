# Plan
I draw a plan over the weekend.The total area of the whole house is about 50 ~ 55 square meters. 
I focus on distinguishing between public and private spaces, dividing each zone through three steps, thus creating a shared and intimate environment. 
I classify the kitchen and living room as public space because it is harmonious and warm for a group of people to eat together, which makes the room home. 
In addition, there is a large fireplace in the center of the living room, and the design of the sinking area allows gathering center of the whole house. 
As for the bedroom, the large-area French windows provide a panoramic view of the mountains, which is spectacular and relaxed.
