# Haozhuo Wu (Anita)

Hi everyone! I am an architectural student, and I quite enjoy what I'm learning now. After my graduation, my short-term goal is to work as a designer in a private designing studio and cultivate my hands-on designing skills. In the long term, I will strive to obtain certificates in architecture and become a project director or chief designer and leverage my expertise to create lasting values.
